# anki-edit-mp3s-externally
This Anki add on adds a button to the add/editor window that when clicked, opens up all mp3 files in the note in whatever audio editor you have set to default in OSx.

This is basically a clone of Dimitry Mikheev's "Edit Audio Images" add on (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1075177705) with a few work arounds to get it working in Mac OSx.

There is no shortcut key to open the file, you must click a button in the add/editor window.

If there is any issues with it, please let me know and I will try my best to fix them. That being said, I have never used python before and I might not be able to fix any bugs!

I also have another Anki add on for editing image files externally:
